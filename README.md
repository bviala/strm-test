# strm-test

## Live demo

## Issues encountered

### Article source logo  
* Some logos could not be fetched from the CDN (403 error).  
* Some logos meant to be wide are padded to fit in a square format, which makes them appear much smaller than other logos

The inconsistent size of the logos could hinder the perceived quality of the UI, so I decided not to include them. Logos are not crucial so these two issues can be further investigated in the future.
